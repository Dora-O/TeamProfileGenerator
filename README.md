# TeamProfileGenerator

Created a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

User will need to use the npm init -y, init install inquirer, and npm i -D jest in terminal.

User will need to access the main folder where index.js exists, run node index.js and follow prompts on command line to generate a team profile.
